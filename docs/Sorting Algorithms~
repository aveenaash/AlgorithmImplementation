Merge Sort

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merge sort is a fast, stable sorting routine with guaranteed O(n*log(n)) efficiency. When 
sorting arrays, merge sort requires additional scratch space proportional to the size of 
the input array. Merge sort is relatively simple to code and offers performance typically 
only slightly below that of quicksort.

Steps to implement Merge Sort:

1) Divide the unsorted array into n partitions, each partition contains 1 element. Here the 
one element is considered as sorted.
2) Repeatedly merge partitioned units to produce new sublists until there is only 1 sublist 
remaining. This will be the sorted list at the end.
